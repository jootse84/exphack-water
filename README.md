This is a web application that intakes water supply and population data and graphically displays a basic analysis on a 3D map using Mapbox. It can help us visualize the supply and demand of water and eventually help us predict the value of water at all the counties within the states. We want to be able to incorporate water source data in the future to better estimate cost, helping us invest in the most efficient sources for water acquisition. 

The varying heights of counties on the map shows the population. The higher the hight, the higher the population within the county.
The colors on the map shows the consumption of water. Darker colors correlate to greater consumption of water.
Clicking on individual counties on the map will show two data points; the amount of water consumed and the population of the county.
We can navigate through the different years on top to see how the supply and demand changes with time.
